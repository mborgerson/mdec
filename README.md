  2. JEB CE requires a license code. It's free. More info [here](backend/jeb/private/README.md).

Components
----------
* Each decompiler is a service that runs in its own container
* A frontend web service proxies requests to backend service

Install
-------
You'll need to add your proprietary packages in `backend/*/private`. Then just:
```
COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose build
```

**Tip:** If you want to build only a few services, append the service names to the above command. For example, to build only the free/open source decompilers you can specify:

```
COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose build \
  frontend \
  angr \
  ghidra \
  r2dec \
  reko \
  retdec \
  snowman
```

Run
---
```
docker compose up
```

Point your browser at http://127.0.0.1.

**Tip:** If you want to start only a few services, append the service names to the above command (e.g. frontend, angr, etc.)

API
---
You can also request decomp like:
```
curl -F 'file=@test.o' http://127.0.0.1/hexrays/decompile
```
